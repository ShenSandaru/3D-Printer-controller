# Scrolling Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Main Container Overflow**
- **Problem**: `overflow: hidden` prevented scrolling
- **Fix**: Changed to `overflowY: 'auto'` with proper height management

### 2. **Sidebar Height Management**
- **Problem**: Components stacked without proper overflow handling
- **Fix**: Implemented flex layout with `flex-shrink-0` for fixed components and `flex-grow-1` for scrollable log

### 3. **Mobile Viewport Issues**
- **Problem**: Mobile browsers have dynamic viewport heights
- **Fix**: Added CSS custom properties and JavaScript for proper viewport height calculation

### 4. **Component-Level Scrolling**
- **Problem**: Individual components had their own scrolling issues
- **Fix**: Applied consistent CSS classes for scrollable containers

## CSS Classes Added:

```css
.main-layout - Main container with proper overflow
.sidebar-container - Sidebar with constrained height and scroll
.viewer-container - 3D viewer with responsive height
.file-list-container - File list with limited height and scroll
.log-container - Log component with proper scroll handling
```

## Mobile Improvements:

1. **Touch Scrolling**: Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
2. **Responsive Heights**: Dynamic height calculation based on viewport
3. **Column Reordering**: 3D viewer appears first on mobile
4. **Optimized Spacing**: Reduced padding and margins on small screens

## JavaScript Enhancements:

- Viewport height calculation for mobile browsers
- Resize and orientation change handlers
- CSS custom properties for dynamic height values

## Browser Compatibility:

- **Chrome/Safari/Firefox**: Full support with smooth scrolling
- **Mobile browsers**: Enhanced touch scrolling and proper viewport handling
- **Internet Explorer**: Basic scrolling support

The scrolling issues have been comprehensively addressed across all device types and screen sizes.
